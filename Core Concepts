Core Concepts
Text Preprocessing
To compare texts effectively, the input documents are cleaned and normalized. This involves:

Lowercasing

Removing punctuation and stop words

Tokenization (breaking text into words or phrases)

Stemming or Lemmatization (reducing words to root forms)

Similarity Detection Techniques
Various algorithms are used to quantify similarity between texts:

Cosine Similarity: Treats text as a vector in a multi-dimensional space and measures the cosine of the angle between them.

Jaccard Similarity: Compares the overlap between sets of words or n-grams.

Fingerprinting: Hashes substrings (shingles) of the document and compares the fingerprints.

Levenshtein Distance: Measures the number of edits required to transform one string into another.

N-Gram Analysis
This method breaks down the text into contiguous sequences of n items (words or characters). Matching n-grams across documents helps detect both exact and partial copying.

Thresholding and Reporting
Based on the similarity score, the system flags potential plagiarism when the score exceeds a predefined threshold. The results may include:

Percentage similarity

Highlighted matched sections

Source URLs or document matches

External Source Matching (Optional)
Advanced plagiarism checkers integrate with web search APIs or document databases to scan beyond local text entries.
